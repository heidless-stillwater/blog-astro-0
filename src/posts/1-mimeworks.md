Hello. My names Rob. I'm long-term IT with numerous diversions along the way.

BSc Computer Science (Distinction) - 1989. Initially, Dev with Sun Microsystem startup in Scotland. SUN latterly bought by Oracle. Subsequently, contractor in London - SYBASE SQL env.

Latterly, Scrum Master/ADM. Fully commited to Collaborative Team Delivery (Agile).

Also, semi-professional in the Arts for 15 years - writer, producer, actor. Amongst much else I learned that a Theatrical Production is simply a Project that CANNOT slip its deadline. Opening Night happens - ready or not ;-)

I am refocusing on Develomment roles. I am full stack capable from inception to deployment. The Scrum Master in me has compelled me to focus on building a clear path to 'Live'. My current focus is Dockerising & Deplying to Google Cloud.

I am actively seeking opportunities with my current ideal being short term contracts with SMART deliverables where I can add demonstrable value with opportunities to gain exposure to latest tech & practices.

Just in case: S.M.A.R.T = Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-based.
